# LLaMA-Based PDF Query System

## Overview
This project utilizes Generative AI with the LLaMA model to enable efficient, query-based information retrieval from large collections of PDF documents. The system improves data accessibility, decision-making, and productivity for businesses by automating the extraction and analysis of valuable business insights.

## Problem
The company struggled with manually searching and analyzing large volumes of PDF documents, leading to slow, error-prone processes that impacted productivity and decision-making.

## Solution
We developed a Generative AI solution that:
- Extracts and analyzes text from PDF documents.
- Allows users to query documents in plain language.
- Delivers fast and accurate responses for business decision support.

## Features
- **Text Extraction**: Converts PDFs into structured text suitable for AI analysis.
- **Natural Language Queries**: Users can ask questions in plain language to retrieve relevant information.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Hosted on a cloud platform to manage large datasets and high query volumes.
- **LLaMA Model Customization**: Fine-tuned to understand the company's specific documents and provide contextually accurate responses.

## Technologies
- **LLaMA Model** for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Python** for data processing and model integration.
- **Cloud Platform** for scalable system deployment.
- **PDF Parsing Libraries** to extract text from PDF files.

## Impact
- Reduced document query time from hours to seconds.
- Improved business decision-making by providing quicker access to important data.
- Increased overall productivity by automating manual document searches and improving data accuracy.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- LLaMA model (instructions below)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llama-pdf-query-system.git
    cd llama-pdf-query-system
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download LLaMA Model**:
    - Download the LLaMA model from the [official source](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama).
    - Follow the instructions on the Hugging Face page to obtain the model.
    - After downloading the model, extract it to a directory on your local machine (e.g., `./models/llama`).

4. **Set Model Path in Notebook**:
    - In the provided notebook (e.g., `notebook.ipynb`), specify the path to the LLaMA model by modifying the following line:

    ```python
    llama_model_path = './models/llama'  # Path to the LLaMA model
    ```

5. Set up the cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, etc.) for deployment.

6. Run the system:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage
1. Upload your PDF documents to the system.
2. Use the query interface to ask questions in plain language.
3. Get fast, accurate results based on the information in the PDFs.
